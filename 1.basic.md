Using a Build Workflow

WHY ?

- Optimize Code
- Use Next-Gen JS Features (ES6 vs ES5)
- Be more Productive

HOW ?

- Use dependency Management Tool npm or yarn
- Use bundler recommended: Webpack
- Use compiler (Nex-Gen JS) Babdel + presets
- Use a development server

1. Understand JSX:
return (
  <div className="App">
    <h1>Hi, I'am a React App</h1>
  </div>
)

return React.createElement('div', {className: 'App'}, React.createElement('h1', null, `Hi, I'm a React App`))

2. JSX Restrictions
   It is a typical thing and a typical best practice to wrap everything into one root element per component

3. Functional component
   React is all about components

4. Understanding children prop
5. Understanding & Using state

- Sometimes you don't want to get some information from outside but you want to have it inside a component and change it from inside there too.

6. Props & State
   Actually, only changes in props and/or state trigger React to re-render your components and potentially update the DOM in the browser.

   1. Props

   - Allow you to pass data from a parent (wrapping) component to a child (embedded) component.

   2. State

   - Whilst props allow you to pass data down the component tree, state is used to change the component well, state from within. Changes to state also trigger an UI update

7. Handle event with methods
8. Stateless vs Stateful components
   1. Stateless component like Person component

- It's a good practice to create as many of these stateless components, also called dump because they have no internal logic or presentational components because they present something, they output content, they only get external data and output it in a structured way

  2.  Stateful component

Have as many pure functional presentational components as possible and only use state no matter how in a few selected components and keep these terms in mind.

9. Passing Methods References Between component
